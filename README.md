# OpenSea Blockchain | Thirdweb, Metamask & Sanity.io

![banner](banner.png)

> In this project I created my own NFT Tokens using the `Thirdweb SDK`, and with send authentication done through `Metamask`, thus making the application dependent on a blockchain network to be accessed. GROQ (Graph-Relational Object Queries) was also used to retrieve data from `Sanity Studio` and display it in the Web 3.0 application. The project is taught on the <strong>Clever Programmer</strong> channel.
