# OpenSea Blockchain | Thirdweb, Metamask & Sanity.io

![banner](banner.png)

> In this project I created my own NFT Tokens using the `Thirdweb SDK`, and with send authentication done through `Metamask`, thus making the application dependent on a blockchain network to be accessed. GROQ (Graph-Relational Object Queries) was also used to retrieve data from `Sanity Studio` and display it in the Web 3.0 application. The project is taught on the <strong>Clever Programmer</strong> channel.

## Blockchain Network 

Blockchain technology is nothing more than a public ledger that `records a virtual currency transaction` (the most popular of which is Bitcoin), so that this record is `reliable` and `immutable`.

The technology `stores the information of a group of transactions in blocks`, marking each block with a timestamp. Every time period (10 minutes on the blockchain), a new block of transactions is formed, which links to the previous block.

`Blocks are dependent on each other` and form a chain of blocks (hence the name: Blockchain). This makes the technology perfect for recording information that needs to be `trusted`, such as in the case of a transaction of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

The blockchain network is made up of miners who verify and record transactions on the block.

To make this possible, miners lend computing power to the network. As an incentive to continue collaborating and make the network sustainable and more secure, they receive a reward in digital currencies.

### Smart Contracts on Blockchain 

A smart contract is a `self-executing computer protocol` created with the popularization of cryptocurrencies and made to facilitate and reinforce the negotiation or performance of a contract, providing reliability in online transactions. With the main objective of allowing unknown people to do business with each other, over the internet `without the need for the intermediary of a central authority`.

In order to be considered a smart contract, the transaction must involve more than a simple transfer of virtual currency between two people (like a payment transfer, for example), it must involve two or more parties (like every contract), and the implementation of the contract should not require direct human involvement from the moment it is signed. Instead of being written on paper in legal language, they are implemented in a `programming language and run on a computer`. In this protocol, strict rules and consequences are defined, in the same way as a legal document, stating the obligations, benefits and penalties of those involved. Furthermore, unlike a traditional contract, a smart contract is able to obtain information, process it and take the appropriate actions provided for in accordance with the contract rules.
